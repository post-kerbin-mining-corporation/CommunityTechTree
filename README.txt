==========================
COMMUNITY TECH TREE v3.3.4
==========================

This is a community designed tech tree designed to support as many mods as possible and extend the KSP tech tree without affecting the stock tree.

Forum thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/90530-131-community-tech-tree-july-26th-new-techs/

============
INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

This mod is only a tech tree! It requires ModuleManager to function.

It also requires mods to support it for their parts to be added. Modders, see the included ForModders.txt file for how to support the Community Tech Tree with your mod.

============
KSP-MINI-AVC
============

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent.
For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).

============
LOCALIZATION
============

This mod includes localization support, and includes translations for
- Spanish (KSP forum user fitiales)
- Russian (KSP forum user vladmir_v)
- Simplified Chinese (Iso-Polaris and EthanWang706)
- Italian (KSP forum user Simog)
Please note that translations are community-sourced and that I don't actually speak anything but French and English, so can't really verify these. If there are issues, please contact the author of the translation.
